1.This Folder contains the Project which uses Convolutional Neural Network to Implement CATS vs DOGS Image Classifer
2.The CNN is Used to Recognize the Images of Cats and Dogs ( used to train the Model) and a new set of Images is given to the 
Network to classifiy
3. The Network in trained with 4000 Images of cats and Dogs and tested with 1000 Images of cats and Dogs to classify
4. The Dataset is a Subset of the Dataset taken from the Following given Kaggle Competition
